I strive to take the position of a Junior Analyst in order to apply my skills in data analysis and processing, as well as develop professional competencies in a dynamic team.

I compensate for the lack of IT experience with fruitful work, performance, and the desire for professional improvement.

Key skills: working with the SQL system, accurate execution of tasks, generation of reports of any complexity, statistics, forecasting, analysis of the received data.

I am currently undergoing Data Analyst training on Hexlet.
